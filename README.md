## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I am trying to work on the UI logic and connect it to the launch screen. I have my code set, that's just the last step. 
Due to much time conflict I didn't have time to dedicate to debugging and diving deep into the logistics but I plan on resubmitting the project so that my vision is correctly shown.
